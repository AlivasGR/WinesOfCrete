A demo e-shop called Wines of Crete. The web app was created as the main project of the undergraduate course CS-360 (Databases: https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~hy360/).

The team consisted of three members (Emmanouil Giortamis https://github.com/manosgior, Georgios Lydakis https://github.com/geomlyd and Anastasios Livanidis https://github.com/AlivasGR) and the work was more or less equally distributed. This repo is a public read-only copy of the original, created for showcasing examples of our work for CV purposes.
